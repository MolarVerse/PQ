### Enhancements

- ASE interface for DFTB+ calculations added
- Add a new keyword 'freset_forces' to reset forces to zero after each step
- init_velocities keyword is ignored if non-zero velocities are present
- init_velocities can now be forced via the 'force' option

### Bug Fixes

### Enhancements

- The reference output file is now decoupled from the .log output file and is given
  its own input file keyword 'reference_file'
- Citations added in the .ref output file for the available QM programs,
  the v-Verlet integrator, the RATTLE algorithm and PQ itself
- BibTeX entries are now included in the .ref output file

### CI

- CI workflows removed `on push` events
